# iRC ROS Controllers

This package contains the custom controllers for the iRC ROS project:
- [Dashboard Controller](#dashboard-controller)
- [DIO Controller](#dio-controller)
- Gripper Controller ([External DIO](#external-dio-gripper) / [ECBPMI](#ecbpmi)) 

## Dashboard Controller
The Dashboard Controller is used to monitor and control the different modules. Currently this is only possible for CPRCANv2, in the future an implementation for CRI might be possible.
The interface works by listening to a multitude of the modules interfaces, in addition to topics such as `/joint_states`, and combines all the information. To simplify listening to the many interfaces `Semantic Component Interfaces` are used. Another example how these work can be found under Links at the end of this readme.
The message types used are defined in `irc_ros_msgs`. 

More information about the dashboard itself can be found in the `irc_ros_dashboard` package.

## DIO Controller
Adds a controller for using DIOs via CAN. The command outputs are for the Rebel_01, if you have a very early rebel model or a different robot please note that it will look different for you. The ReBeL 01 has two inputs and outputs in the arm and seven of each in the base.

### ROS2 Control specific commands
When successfully using this package you should be able to see the DIO Controller:

``` console
$ ros2 control list_controllers

dio_controller      [irc_ros_controllers/DIOController] active    
[...]

$ ros2 control list_hardware_interfaces

command interfaces
	dio_arm/digital_output_0 [available] [claimed]
	dio_arm/digital_output_1 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_0 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_1 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_2 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_3 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_4 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_5 [available] [claimed]
	dio_base/digital_output_6 [available] [claimed]
    [...]

state interfaces
	dio_arm/digital_input_0
	dio_arm/digital_input_1
	dio_base/digital_input_0
	dio_base/digital_input_1
	dio_base/digital_input_2
	dio_base/digital_input_3
	dio_base/digital_input_4
	dio_base/digital_input_5
	dio_base/digital_input_6
    [...]

```

Note that the hardware command interfaces are claimed by this controller and are provided by the `irc_ros_hardware` package, more precise by the CAN implementation.

### Setting states
The setting of states is done over messages or service calls.
To see all available output controllers you can use:
``` console
$ ros2 topic list
[...]
/dio_controller/set_outputs
[...]
/external_dio_controller/set_outputs
[...]

$ ros2 service list
[...]
/dio_controller/set_outputs
[...]
/external_dio_controller/set_outputs
[...]
```

Currently you can only see which outputs are available via the controller configuration file. In the future a `list_outputs` command could be an option.

Setting states works like the following:

``` console 
$ ros2 topic pub --once /dio_controller/set_outputs irc_ros_msgs/msg/DioCommand '{names:[dio_arm/digital_output_0, ],outputs: [False, ]}'

$ ros2 service call /dio_controller/set_outputs irc_ros_msgs/srv/DioCommand '{names:[dio_arm/digital_output_0, ],outputs: [False, ]}'
```

The service call will respond with success unless the number of outputs names and states do not match.

### Reading out states
Currently there is no way to read out all inputs via one topic. Reading out a single digital input works over the corrosponding `/[module_name]/[input_name]/state` topic, e.g.:

The available controllers can be seen with the following command:
``` console
$ ros2 topic list
[...]
/dio_controller/get_inputs
[...]
/external_dio_controller/get_inputs
[...]
```

### External DIO Gripper
A gripper connected to the CAN bus via an external DIO-Module is also controlled over the dio controller as follows:

``` console
$ ros2 topic pub --once /external_dio_controller/set_outputs irc_ros_msgs/msg/DioCommand '{names:[dio_ext/digital_output_0, ],outputs: [True, ]}'
```

Note: The meshes included by the respective urdf files are not correct, instead the same as the ones for the ECBPMI are used temporarily.

## ECBPMI
Controller for the [Schmalz ECBPMI](https://www.schmalz.com/en-us/vacuum-technology-for-robotics/vacuum-generators/vacuum-generators-ecbpmi-312576/) vacuum gripper. Since the grasp/release functionality and feedback are more complicated than toggling a single digital output a separate controller is implemented.
One of the signals control the generate vacuum pin (normally dio_arm/digital_output_0), which starts the pump until a stable vacuum is detected. The release vacuum pin (normally dio_arm/digital_output_1) vacates the vacuum again and thus releases the grasped object.
The gripper gives feedback if a vacuum is currently active (normally dio_arm_digital_input_0). The controller waits for this signal after a grip/release command to confirm the success. If a timeout of 1 second (Set in the schamlz_ecbpmi_controller.hpp) is reached the controller replies that the gripping was unsuccessful.
A second output signal is available for user definable feedback (normally dio_arm_digital_input_1), which is currently not implemented in the controller.


### Command
Gripping is possible via topic and service call:
``` console
$ ros2 topic pub --once /ecbpmi_controller/set_gripper irc_ros_msgs/msg/GripperCommand "{grip: false}"
```

Setting states via service call can be done like this:

``` console
$ ros2 service call /ecbpmi_controller/set_gripper irc_ros_msgs/srv/GripperCommand "{grip: true}"
```

The service response is equivalent to the state topic content.

### State
The gripper state is published to a topic. It provides information if the vacuum is stable, meaning the gripper is successfully gripping.

``` console
$ ros2 topic echo /ecbpmi_controller/gripper_state
header:
  stamp:
    sec: 1675961396
    nanosec: 456334931
  frame_id: ''
grasped: false
```
