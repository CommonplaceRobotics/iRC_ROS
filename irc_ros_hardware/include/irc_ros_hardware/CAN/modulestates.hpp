/**
 * @brief The module states for CAN specific functionality.
 * 
 * If anything from here is useful for CRI it should be copied to common/errorstates.hpp, which at
 * this point should be renamed. Some of the functionality here is only useful for motor modules,
 * not for gpio modules. Currently this is ignored and the unused states will stay at their default
 * values.
 * 
 * This file is used from module.hpp but also from the irc_ros_controllers/dashboard_controller.hpp
 * to interpret the exchanged values. Any changes here need to be adapted in both files.
