# igus Robot Control with ROS2 Humble

**This is an early beta version. The code WILL change in the near future and is not intended for any serious work right now. If you still use it be cautious when running it on your hardware and know that updating this package may break your running setup!**

This repository aims to bring ROS2 support to igus robots. The main focus and is the igus ReBeL in the 6 DOF version, but other devices may also be used, as long as robot controller modules from Commonplace Robotics are used in the kinematics. For a list of currently supported hardware see below.
The hardware communication is available with two different protocols, CRI and CPRCANv2. Links containing more information about these can be found below. The CRI implementation is build upon a ROS Noetic project by [Truphysics](https://www.truphysics.com/), which is linked below as well.

## TODO
 - Release roadmap
   - Convert TODOs into issues
     - Add package specific tags
     - Add robot specific tags
   - Extensive testing, including setting up the entire system from scratch/on different OSs
   - Add guidelines for PRs, issue templates
   - License boilerplates for each source code file?
   - Ask for feedback from ROS2 community
   - Once everything is mostly stable create a PR [here](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/supported_robots/supported_robots.html) to be in the official list of ros2_control supporting robots
 - Dockerfile for Ubuntu-LTS-less usage of the package?
   - Might be useful for CI and/or testing as well
 - Gazebo support?
 - Automate testing and documentation generation
    - Fix missing ament installs for pre-commit
      - The requirements are added to the pipeline but do not run with pre-commit under github actions.
      - Works locally when using act
    - Use cache/artifacts to speed up CI
    - Use ros2 dockerfile instead of ros-tooling/setup-ros which is rather slow and flaky to build?
    - Use ros-industrial ci instead?
    - use ament_clang_tidy in CI? It is supposed to be [very slow](https://github.com/ament/ament_lint/issues/283), maybe only on pre-commit push actions?
    - Implement test cases and add them to [ROS2 CI](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci)
    - [ROSDOC2](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdoc2) could replace Doxygen

## Overview
The structure of the project tries to follow the general structure of similar ROS2 projects. The following graph tries to provide a general overview of the different packages and how they interact with each other:

![An overview of the different packages](doc/Architecture.png)

For basic robot interaction only irc_ros_hardware, irc_ros_description and irc_ros_bringup are required. The hardware package is used for the communication itself, description contains the robot definitions and bringup the necessary files to start the underlying software.
For robot motion planing moveit is used, the launch file for an igus ReBeL can be found in the irc_ros_moveit_config package. When using a mobile platform Navigation 2 is used, again with the files contained in the irc_ros_navigation package.
The controllers package is used to provide additional module functionality, one of them is providing the data for the dashboard package. For all this the interfacing uses custom messages, which can be found in the respective package.
Last, for some implementation examples please take a look at irc_ros_examples.

## Supported Hardware:
In general all kinematics using CPR modules are usable with this drivers hardware interface. Configuration files are included for the following devices:
 - Robots
   - [igus ReBeL (multiple versions)](https://www.igus.de/product/20962?artNr=REBEL-6DOF-01) 
   - [igus Robolink RL DP 5 ](https://www.igus.de/product/20239?artNr=RL-DP-5) (**See note below**)
 - Platforms
   - [Commonplace Robotics Platform Medium/Butler](https://cpr-robots.com/servicerobotics#mobileplatformmedium)
 - Grippers
   - [Schmalz ECBPMI vacuum gripper](https://www.schmalz.com/en-us/vacuum-technology-for-robotics/vacuum-generators/vacuum-generators-ecbpmi-312576/)
   - Custom CAN controlled gripper ("ext_dio_gripper")

**The main focus is on the igus ReBeL 6DOF robot. All other devices are maintained are only provided as is.**

**Note for Robolink DP 5:** When using the Robolink DP 5 and similar robots you need to reference the axes before being able to use it. This happens automatically on startup in an unsafe manner. If you are an user of this robot please wait for an update for this issue or be very careful during startup.

In case you want to add your own kinematics please take a look at `irc_ros_description/README.md`. If they are a standard device that might be useful for other people please also consider creating a pull request for it :)

## Requirements
This project will only run under linux. One of the main issues is the use of linux sockets for interfacing with the hardware. If an adequate, open source and multi-platform alternative exists, it might be possible for the community to replace the linux-only parts.

General requirements:
 - Ubuntu 22.04 (Recommended)
 - Compiler with C++17 support, e.g. a semi-recent gcc install
 - [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)
   - Might work with ROS2 Iron out of the box as well, but is untested
 - Direct access to the robots CAN bus or an ethernet connection to the `TinyCtrl` host
 - Optional, only required for parts of the project:
   - [Moveit2 (stable)](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/binary/)
   - [Navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org/build_instructions/index.html)
   - [RQT Robot Steering](https://github.com/cpr-fer/rqt_robot_steering/tree/twiststamped)
   - [Sick S300_2](https://github.com/ajtudela/sicks300_2/tree/humble)
   - [IRA Laser Tools](https://github.com/nakai-omer/ira_laser_tools/tree/humble)
   - [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)

While ros2_control recommends the use of a real-time kernel we used a standard Ubuntu 22.04 install without encountering any issues. 

## Setup
Install all necessary requirements for the functionality you intend to use and then simply clone this in the src/ directory of a ROS2 workspace.

### CRI specific setup
When using CRI make sure the [Embedded Control](https://cpr-robots.com/robot-control#electronics) is reachable under the ip address set in the `irc_ros_description/urdf/*.ros2_control.xacro` configs (default: `192.168.3.11`) You should be able to ping the module in case you are unsure if the ip address is correct

### CAN specific setup
When using CAN set up the interface (default: `can0`, set in the same file as CRI configs) to the right baud rate (500kHz, see the [Protocol User Guide](https://cpr-robots.com/download/CAN/CPR_CAN_Protocol_V2_UserGuide_en.pdf)) and make sure it is up with the command below. This also turns on auto-restarting the interface in case of errors.
Note: This has to be done after each restart, you can also put it in your autostart. This can't be done automatically in the hardware interface as it requires root privileges. 

``` bash
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000 restart-ms 1000
```
Another option when using systemd is to configure it via systemd-networkd. The config is taken from [here](https://www.pengutronix.de/en/blog/2022-02-04-initializing-can-interfaces-with-systemd-networkd.html)

```
# /etc/systemd/network/80-can.network
[Match]
Name=can0

[CAN]
BitRate=500K
RestartSec=1000ms
```

Make sure that systemd-networkd is enabled when you use this approach.
``` bash
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd

# To test it without having to restart
sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd
```

## Contributing
CI is done via a Github Action calling a pre-commit file. Please test your pull requests before pushing by running run pre-commit locally.
